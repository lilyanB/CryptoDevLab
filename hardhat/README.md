# CryptoDevLab

A GitHub repository containing multiple Ethereum outils, including Solidity smart contracts and JavaScript scripts.

## Formation

I acquired knowledge and copy the code from the following educational resource:

- [learnweb3](https://learnweb3.io/degrees)

- [EVM structure](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/senior/how-ethereum-nodes-store-data-and-executes-smart-contracts)

- [My profil](https://learnweb3.io/u/lilyanb)

This resource provides valuable information and training in the field of Ethereum development and blockchain technology.

## Description

This repository houses a collection of outils related to the Ethereum blockchain. Each project is organized within its own directory with its documentation and usage instructions. Refer to individual sections to learn more about each project.

## Included Outils

1. [Merkle Trees](/hardhat/contracts/MerkleTrees.sol) - Solidity of the "Merkle Trees" outils.
2. [Flash Loans](/hardhat/contracts/FlashLoanExample.sol) - Solidity of the "Flash Loans" outils.
3. [Re-entrancy](/hardhat/contracts/Re-entrancy.sol) - Solidity of the "Re-entrancy" outils.
4. [Access private data](/hardhat/contracts/Login.sol) - Solidity of the "Access private data" outils.
5. [Delegatecall](/hardhat/contracts/Delegatecall.sol) - Solidity of the "Delegatecall" outils.
6. [NoRandom](/hardhat/contracts/NoRandom.sol) - Solidity of the "NoRandom" outils. follow [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/vrf)
7. [DOS](/hardhat/contracts/DOS.sol) - Solidity of the "DOS" outils.
7. [MetaTx](/hardhat/contracts/MetaTokenSender.sol) - Solidity of the "MetaTx" outils.


## Repository Structure

The repository's structure is organized as follows:

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
